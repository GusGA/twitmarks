# twitmarks
Twitter Bookmarks for the web and desktop.

![Twitmarks](./logo.png "Twitmarks logo")

*Very much WIP, but works fine on Chrome, have not tested on Firefox.*


# Demo
![Twitmarks Demo](./demo3.gif "Twitmarks Demo")

# Installation
- Clone this repo
- Switch on Developer Mode in `settings > extensions`
- Click on `Load unpacked extension`
- Browse to this directory and select

# Usage
Just install the addon, visit twitter and you're good to go.

## Note
I can only self host this because I do not have an international card, nor do I have $25 to create
a developer account on webstore. So, as soon as the Firefox version is working if that is free.

# Inspiration
One of the person I lookup to when it comes to product building is @AviAryan,
and it's about this twitter thread.
