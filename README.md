# twitmarks
Twitter Bookmarks for the web and desktop.

Very much WIP, but works fine on Chrome, have not tested on Firefox.

# Demo

# Installation

# Usage
Just install the addon, visit twitter and you're good to go.

## Note
I can only self host this because I do not have an international card, nor do I have $25 to create
a developer account on webstore. So, as soon as the Firefox version is working if that is free.

# Inspiration
One of the person I lookup to when it comes to product building is @AviAryan,
and it's about this twitter thread.
